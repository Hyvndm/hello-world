# hello-world
first order of business.
We always start with an idea..
But idea is there and we find it 
or we create the idea?
lines of codes are lines of ideas in symbolic language..
Language is the source of the ideas or ideas created the language?
ideas seems to follow the language, they are fenced by the barriers of language
but yet words are empty vessels without ideas that define the meaning
there is some quality in sensation that is more then words can describe
that defies limitations of everyday language but yet we try to limit them to their language prisons
like some emotions, we try to express them with language but its not always enough
some feelings can overwhelm you but tying to express them with words feels not enough
and even if you can express them to your liking, others beside you will have their own judgements
Sometimes discords create more pain then the initial feelings
