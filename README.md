# hello-world
first order of business.
We always start with an idea..
But idea is there and we find it 
or we create the idea?
lines of codes are lines of ideas in symbolic language..
Language is the source of the ideas or ideas created the language?
ideas seems to follow the language, they are fenced by the barriers of language
but yet words are empty vessels without ideas that define the meaning
